# mwprop.ne2001p v1.0 Jan 2024

"""
Python versions of functions in scattering98.f that is
part of the NE2001 Fortran package

2019 December 31

Added: 
    transition_frequency_from_obs
    sm_from_tau
------
Notes in 1998-2001 Fortran version: 
This version from 18 March 1998 uses revised coefficients 
that are consistent with Cordes \& Rickett (1998, ApJ)

Note that scaling laws are explicitly for a Kolmogorov medium 
in the strong but not superstrong regime 
(as defined in Cordes and Lazio 1991)

Removed theta_iso_test (was redundant)

Modifications:
28 March 2001: added FUNCTION TRANSITION_FREQUENCY

    on the image that extend to larger angles than for a Gaussian function.

    the angular variance.    This relation depends on linner and
    \lambda^2 SM.  This is shown in the notes 'Cosmological Integrals
